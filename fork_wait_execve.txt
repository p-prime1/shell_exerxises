Write a program that executes the command ls -l /tmp in 5 different child processes. Each child should be created by the same process (the father). Wait for a child to exit before creating a new child.
Start by:

Declare the necessary header files
Declare status
Declare child id
Declare argv(array to be used for execv)

Write a loop for i less then 5
fork the child process
check for error

check if child id = 0
Pass the execv function with its parameters

else call waitpid with the status (wait pid is used cus of its flexibiltiy
use exit status macros
